# Boxel Engine

## Overview: A simplistic game engine developed from scratch for the purposes of learning the fundamentals of game engine development

### Goals:
#### 1) To develop a complete working game engine capable of creating a single, playable level for a 2D platformer
#### 2) To explore optimization and performance differences between various memory management and rendering algorithms
#### 3) To test and identify the FPS thresholds for many game entities (hundreds, thousands, and beyond)
#### 4) To identify the largest impactors on FPS for simplistic 2D games which have no image files
